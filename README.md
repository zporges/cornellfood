cornellfood
===========
The apk is within the androidapp folder. The web app can also be tested at zachporges.com/cornellfood,
but the site is only optimized for mobile.

The androidapp and iphoneapp folders contain simple native apps which wrap the webapp.
These apps have a url of zachporges.com/cornellfood hardcoded, and will need to be updated
if the web app is hosted at another domain.

The webapp folder contains the HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript for pulling food information
from the database, displaying it to users, and letting users select/save meals locally.

The pythonscripts folder contains scripts to insert the data into the database.

The .sql file contains a database dump as of Wednesday November 20 2013.
